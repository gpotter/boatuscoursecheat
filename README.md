## Boatus.org cheater

Need help on a boatus.org example quiz? This will put a big green 'NEXT' button in the top right of the page that will both defeat the 'next' timer as well and automatically answer the quiz question.

### Installation

1. Download [this file](dist/boatusquiz.crx)
2. Open <chrome://extensions/> in Google Chrome browser
3. Click the Developer Mode checkbox in the top right
4. Drag the `boatusquiz.crx` file on top of the <chrome://extensions/> page.
5. Go to boatus.org and start the e-learning module. When the window https://elearning.boatus.org/launch/lesson.asp pops up, it should have a big green button with NEXT in the upper right. Keep clicking the button to move through all the review topics and quiz questions.
